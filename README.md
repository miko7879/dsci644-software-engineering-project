# DSCI644 Final Project

GitHub repository to store the content for my final project for DSCI644 - Software Engineering for Data Science. This project was carried out in 4/5 person teams. My role was to design the software architecture and the XGBoost analysis. The project involved the design (but not implementation) of a ML model hosting system, as well as the analysis of a reviews dataset to predict user sentiment. Please see the design document for more details. It can be found under ./content/documentation
