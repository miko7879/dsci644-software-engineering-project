# DSCI644 Final Project

GitHub repository to store the content for my final project for DSCI644 - Software Engineering for Data Science. The project involved the design (but not implementation) of a ML model hosting system, as well as the analysis of a reviews dataset to predict user sentiment. This project was carried out in 4/5 person teams, where my role was to design the software architecture and to analyze the assigned dataset using XGBoost. The design document contains all the details, and can be found in the ./content/documentation directory.
